# VIPAS-CAVOLO-PROJECT
VIPAS cavolo project github repository (for model VP100s.) detailed information will be found here.


# description 

The VIPAS cavolo VP100 (shortened to Cavolo) is a BadUSB type device operating on a small microcontroller with the Arduino Leonardo program installed. A BadUSB is a device that can act as a HID (Human Interface Device). common examples of HIDs are keyboards, computer mouse, touchscreen, etc. 
These are devices suppose to be used by people to interact with their device, and the Cavolo acts like one. It is programmed using the Arduino IDE software with code developed by VIPAS. The default program simply uses short cuts on most desktop devices such as PCs and laptops to close all current open and running tabs.

# code

The Cavolo VP100 source code is listed in the file "source-code-cavolo", feel free to change it to your liking using the Arduino IDE software: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software



The program is written in a customized version of the C++ programming language. If you have expertise in it you can easily change around some of the actions within the code. For those who don't, it may take around 3-5 months to get a good hang of it. If you do not want to learn it, Github and other sites have endless amounts of code you can copy and paste. Within this reposistory there are example codes popular with BadUSB devices you may try out.
